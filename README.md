# My Emacs Plugins

## About

This repository contains a collection of custom functions created to enrich
my daily programming in Emacs. It also marks my first forays into the wonderful,
if underappreciated, language that is Lisp. For this is after all a learning
experience, the code will inevitably be littered with awkward syntax, contrived
structures and silly bugs. As such, readers are welcome to critique, reach out
and contribute to this growing project.
